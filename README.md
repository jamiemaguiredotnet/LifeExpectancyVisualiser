# LifeExpectancyVisualiser

Hacked together a life expectancy visualiser from my cell phone.

Built using GPT 4o in less that 5 minutes with a single prompt.

Enter your date of birth and it renders a series of circles for each year of your life.

Visualisation:

Red: Years that have passed
Green: Optimal active years
Amber: Senior years
